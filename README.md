### About
Welcome to my ICS/OT hub — the Batcave for industrial systems. Here, you can explore, simulate, and experiment with **PLCs, SCADA dashboards, and automation systems** in a safe, controlled environment.  
Think of it as a place where curiosity meets control, and technology bends to your will.  

💡 **Secret Note:** Some simulations may feel like they’re watching you… in a good way.  

---

### Why This Exists
Industrial Control Systems are critical, sensitive, and sometimes vulnerable.  
After **23 years in water and wastewater**, I’m just now seeing the thing that keeps me up at night — the subtle systems, protocols, and hidden vulnerabilities that most never notice.  
This landing page is my sandbox: a space to learn, experiment, and sharpen skills without risking the real world.

### Features
- **Interactive Simulations:** Virtual valves, sensors, and SCADA dashboards you can experiment with.  
- **Scripts & Tools:** Python experiments, monitoring utilities, and automation projects.  
- **Learning Resources:** Cheatsheets, guides, and breakdowns of common ICS/OT protocols.  
- **Hidden Easter Eggs:** Find little references and nods to the tech‑superhero in some simulations 😉

### Tech Behind the Curtain
- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** (slick interface, dark mode vibes)  
- **Backend:** Python / Flask for simulations and tools  
- **Hardware Integrations:** Raspberry Pi & Arduino experiments  
- **Safe Environments:** Docker and isolated simulations  

---

Mission

Keep learning. Keep experimenting. Keep your systems secure.

### Quick Start
Clone the repository and dive in:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Papaperun/OT-Quest.git
cd OT-Quest
