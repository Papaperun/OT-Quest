Core Threat Recap
The “Typhoon” campaigns (Volt, Flax, Salt, etc.) aren’t isolated hacks—they’re the sharp end of a decades-long PRC cyber evolution that’s turned espionage into a scalable weapon. This presents a massive, systemic issue for U.S. critical infrastructure, where pre-positioned access could flip from spying to sabotage overnight.
Key Milestones in PRC Cyber Buildup
2014 Indictment of PLA Officers: U.S. DOJ charged five officers from China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Unit 61398 with cyber theft of trade secrets from U.S. companies (e.g., Westinghouse, US Steel, Alcoa). This was the first public U.S. attribution of state-sponsored economic espionage—hacking for competitive advantage, not just intel.
2015 OPM Breach: Office of Personnel Management (OPM) hack, attributed to PRC actors, stole sensitive clearance data on over 22 million Americans (including fingerprints, financials, and background details). It started via a contractor (KeyPoint Government Solutions) in late 2013, with exfiltration running into 2015. This wasn’t just data theft—it was building a massive dossier on U.S. government personnel for long-term leverage.
Personal note: “I’m starting to worry about all those ads saying ‘your personal data was found!’ Now it hits different—imagine that info in Beijing’s hands, tied to your security clearance. Creepy as hell.”
Strategic Shifts in PRC Tactics
Gray Zone Warfare Integration: PRC blends cyber ops with “gray zone” tactics—coercive actions below open war but above diplomacy (e.g., economic pressure, disinformation, proxy influence). These pair with armed conflicts for deniable escalation, like disrupting U.S. logistics in a Taiwan crisis without firing a shot. Cyber fits perfectly: low-cost, hard-to-attribute, and scalable.
AI-Powered Scaling: China’s leveraging AI to supercharge cyber capabilities—automating vulnerability scans, phishing at mass scale, and even generating deepfakes for influence ops. This evolves raw hacking into “cognitive warfare,” where AI spots patterns in networks faster than humans, turning espionage into predictive disruption.
Defender Imperatives for Critical Systems Operators
For folks like us running water plants, energy grids, or telco: Assume PRC actors are already in your systems (they probably are). Focus on:
Detecting subtle anomalies (e.g., credential abuse, unusual data flows—Volt Typhoon’s MO).
Aggressive patching and segmentation (close old vulns before they weaponize).
Real-World Patch Urgency: OpenPLC ScadaBR Vulns (Dec 2025): CISA just flagged active exploits (CVE-2021-26828/26829) in this open-source SCADA HMI—file upload for RCE and XSS for session theft. Hacktivists trashed a water plant honeypot in days using defaults. Ties back to your repo/WaterISAC notes: If we're still on unpatched legacy PLCs, we're one bad upload from backflow city.
Personal note: “An event harder to do—see my notes in [show my repo link]. And check WaterISAC fundamentals. We’re talking legacy SCADA gear that hasn’t seen a patch since Bush was president. Budgets? Laughable. Manpower? Nonexistent. This is why I eat lunch staring at pumps like they’re about to explode.”
Wrapping the Chapter
This evolution isn’t random—it’s deliberate PLA doctrine, from theft (2014) to mass intel grabs (OPM) to embedded disruption (Typhoons today). PRC’s endgame: A “shock collar” on U.S. infra that they control, scaled by AI, executed via gray zone deniability. We’re not just defending bits and bytes; we’re holding the line on civilization’s basics.
