Chapter 3: Volt Typhoon – The Threat in Focus
Discovery and Origins
In May 2023, Microsoft publicly disclosed Volt Typhoon, a PRC state-sponsored cyber actor believed to have been active since at least mid-2021. The group’s activities demonstrate China’s deliberate intent to pose a strategic threat to U.S. critical infrastructure, particularly in a crisis (e.g., Taiwan conflict). Unlike traditional espionage, Volt Typhoon’s tactics suggest a focus on pre-positioning for disruption or sabotage, not just data theft.
Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)

Hands-on-Keyboard Operations: Volt Typhoon uses direct, manual interaction with systems (not just automated scripts), allowing tailored attacks that adapt to unique network environments. This term refers to live operators actively navigating compromised systems, making them harder to detect than mass malware drops.
Living-off-the-Land (LotL): They leverage built-in system tools (e.g., PowerShell, WMI) and valid credentials to blend into normal network activity, avoiding traditional malware that triggers antivirus. This stealth lets them dwell undetected for years—some intrusions lasted 5+ years.
Credential Abuse and Proxy Networks: They steal legitimate admin credentials and use compromised routers (e.g., Cisco, NetGear via the KV Botnet) as proxies to mask their origins. This enables lateral movement from IT to Operational Technology (OT) systems, where they can disrupt physical processes like pumps or power relays.
Targeted Sectors: Communications, manufacturing, utilities (water, electricity), transportation, maritime, government, IT, and education. Strategic focus on U.S. territories like Guam, critical for military logistics in the Indo-Pacific.Personal note: “I caught myself thinking only about water because it’s my world, but this hits everything. Water, power, telco, ports—it’s all connected. One goes down, the rest domino. That’s what’s so damn troubling.”

Strategic Intent
Volt Typhoon’s behavior deviates from typical PRC espionage (e.g., OPM’s data grab). U.S. agencies (CISA, NSA, FBI) assess with high confidence that the group is pre-positioning for disruptive cyberattacks, not just intel collection. Their access to OT systems could enable sabotage—think shutting off water treatment, blacking out grids, or crippling port cranes during a geopolitical crisis. This aligns with Beijing’s broader “shock collar” strategy to deter or delay U.S. military/civilian response in a conflict.
U.S. Response and Mitigation

FBI Takedown (Jan 2024): The FBI, with private-sector partners, conducted a court-authorized operation to dismantle Volt Typhoon’s KV Botnet, removing malware from hundreds of end-of-life Cisco and NetGear routers across the U.S. These routers were used to proxy malicious traffic and hide PRC origins.
Caveat: Volt Typhoon quickly rebuilt parts of the botnet, showing resilience.

CISA Recommendations: Patch internet-facing systems (prioritize critical vulns), enforce phishing-resistant MFA, enable robust logging, and retire end-of-life hardware. Easier said than done for underfunded utilities.
Ongoing Challenge: Despite the takedown, Volt Typhoon’s stealth and long-term access (some networks since 2021) mean they’re likely still embedded in many systems.

Why It Matters
Volt Typhoon isn’t a “smash-and-grab” spy network; it’s a patient, calculated threat aiming to hold U.S. infrastructure hostage. Their ability to move from IT to OT (e.g., from office servers to water plant SCADA) means they could trigger real-world harm—backflow disasters, power outages, or stalled military logistics—at Beijing’s whim. The interconnectedness of these sectors amplifies the risk: a water plant outage could cripple hospitals, data centers, or factories within hours.
Personal Reflection
“I’m wired to focus on my corner—water, pumps, pipes. But reading this, it’s clear it’s all one big web. If they hit telco, I can’t get alarms. If they hit power, my pumps stop. If they hit maritime, supply chains for chlorine or parts dry up. It’s not just ‘my plant’ anymore. It’s the whole damn country, and that’s what keeps me up at night.”
