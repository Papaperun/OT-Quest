Why these notes exist
I’m just a guy who treats drinking water for a living. I’ve spent twenty-plus years fixing pumps at 3 a.m., rebuilding valves in the snow, and praying the SCADA doesn’t crash on Christmas.
Then I read Code Red and realized the same pumps I baby every day are now on a target list next to power grids, hospitals, and ports.
This repo is me wrestling that report into language I can actually use at the lunch table, in the control room, or when I’m explaining to the city manager why we suddenly need money we don’t have.
What you’ll find here

Chapter-by-chapter breakdowns in plain English
My raw reactions (“this sounds like Cobra from G.I. Joe,” “greed put us here,” etc.) – left in on purpose because that’s how I remember it
Direct ties back to water/wastewater realities (backflow nightmares, unpatched XP boxes, zero budget, etc.)
Occasional “oh shit” moments when something hits way too close to home

These are living study notes. I’m adding chapters as I grind through them. If you’re in critical infrastructure (water, power, telco, wastewater, whatever), maybe some of this will help you translate the doom-scroll into something you can actually act on tomorrow morning.
Bottom line
The report is terrifying.
Drinking it in anyway feels like purpose.
Pull up the PDF, grab a coffee (or an energy drink, no judgment), and come learn with me.
