Main Thesis
By deeply embedding in global critical infrastructure (especially U.S.), aggressively exploiting telecom networks, and rapidly weaponizing new vulnerabilities, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is building a massive arsenal of “access & disruption” options it could activate during a crisis or war.
Key PRC Campaign: “Volt Typhoon” (and family)
Microsoft calls the whole ecosystem of PRC state actors “Typhoon” actors. Volt Typhoon is the most dangerous one discussed.
Unprecedented surge in activity in recent years
Goal = pre-positioning for possible future conflict (especially over Taiwan)
Living-off-the-land techniques: uses legitimate credentials, no malware → extremely hard to detect
Already inside U.S. energy, water/wastewater, telecommunications, transportation sectors
My reaction when I first read this → “This sounds like bigotry… until you read the details and realize it’s documented reality.”
Secondary reaction → “Once again, corporate greed put us here. ‘Cheaper is better’ turned into ‘we literally gave them the keys.’”
The “Shock Collar” Metaphor
Volt Typhoon = a hidden shock collar China has quietly slipped around America’s neck.
They can trigger it whenever they want (or not). The fact that we don’t know the exact “if/when/why” is the entire point.
Specific Typhoon Variants Mentioned
Volt Typhoon → critical infrastructure (energy, water, etc.) – pre-positioned disruption
Flax Typhoon → exploits IoT devices for long-term spying
Salt Typhoon → major breach of U.S. telecom providers (wiretap-level access)
Others (Linen, Violent, Silk, Nylon, etc.) → different branches specializing in zero-day exploitation
Personal note → “These code names sound like Cobra cells from G.I. Joe.”
Personal note #2 → “We banned Furbies from government buildings in the 90s because they might record things… but sure, let’s put Amazon Alexa and cheap Chinese IoT in every SCADA system and call it progress.”
Most At-Risk Sectors (the real “crown jewels”)
Energy grid
Water / wastewater
Hospitals
Military bases
Data centers
From my own water-plant experience:
Shutting off even one pump for 30 seconds can cause backflow, contamination events, or catastrophic pressure surges. This isn’t subtle sabotage with a big explosion — it’s quiet, deniable, and can cascade for days.
→ It’s literally a “throw a wrench in it… or don’t” decision that someone in Beijing could make from a keyboard.
Why Sanctions & Attribution Are Almost Useless Here
IPs are spoofed (exactly what any VPN does)
Attacks use legitimate credentials and built-in tools → looks like normal admin activity
Even if we prove it was China, extradition is a fantasy
→ “You have no power here” Gandalf meme applies perfectly
Official U.S. Counter-Strategy (what they say needs to happen)
Zero Trust architecture everywhere
Real-time detection and response
Better public-private coordination
Patch faster, segment networks, remove default credentials, etc.
Legal / policy changes
My take from the lunch table at the water plant:
This is a MASSIVE undertaking. Most utilities (especially small/medium ones) are 10–20 years behind. We still have Windows XP boxes air-gapped with a USB stick someone brings from home. Zero Trust sounds great in a PowerPoint, but the budget and manpower simply aren’t there yet.
Final personal thought I keep repeating to myself
I never in my life thought I’d say, “I hope the water I treat doesn’t go to X because I think Y might turn the pumps off,” but here we are.
