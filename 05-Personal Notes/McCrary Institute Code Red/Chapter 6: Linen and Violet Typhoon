Chapter 6: Linen and Violet Typhoon – Zero-Day Exploitation and Strategic Targeting
Overview
Chapter 6 dives into two more PRC-linked "Typhoon" actors: Linen Typhoon and Violet Typhoon. Microsoft publicly linked both to the rapid exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in on-premises Microsoft SharePoint servers in July 2025. This campaign highlights China's cyber maturity—quickly weaponizing fresh flaws for espionage and influence ops. While Volt/Flax/Salt focus on infrastructure disruption, Linen and Violet target intellectual property (IP) theft and information warfare, showing the Typhoon family's breadth. Their speed in jumping on zero-days is alarming, but as you noted, it's not unique to China—Russian actors like Fancy Bear (APT28) and Sandworm (APT44) pull similar stunts against Ukraine.
The SharePoint Zero-Day Chain (July 2025)

What Happened: Starting around July 7, 2025, attackers chained multiple flaws in on-premises SharePoint (not the cloud version):
CVE-2025-49704 (remote code execution, RCE) and CVE-2025-49706 (spoofing)—patched July 8, but exploited pre-patch with public PoCs by July 14.
CVE-2025-53770 (security bypass) and CVE-2025-53771 (related flaw)—zero-days disclosed July 19, fully addressed in emergency updates July 22.
Dubbed the "ToolShell" exploit chain, it allowed unauthenticated attackers to upload malicious files, execute code, and steal data from internet-facing servers. Microsoft disrupted active exploits by July 22, but hundreds of orgs (global enterprises, research firms) were hit before patches landed.

Zero-Day Explained: A "zero-day" means the vendor (Microsoft) has zero days' notice to fix it—attackers strike before patches exist. Your analogy nails it: Like running a water plant with no CL2 residual (chlorine level). if you don't chlorinate now, bacteria blooms and people get sick. No buffer; it's immediate action or catastrophe.Personal question: “I wonder how people find zero-days? This requires further looking.” (Quick aside: Zero-days often come from bug bounties, reverse-engineering leaked code, or insider tips. Nation-states like China run massive "vulnerability farms"—teams fuzzing software 24/7. More on that in a sec if you want a deep-dive.)

Linen Typhoon: IP Theft and Espionage Focus

Profile: Linen Typhoon (overlaps with Recorded Future's TAG-67) exemplifies China's cyber maturity in economic espionage. They exploit zero-days/n-days for initial access, then dwell long-term to siphon IP. Tied to PRC's "Made in China 2025" push for tech dominance.
Targets: Research institutions, advanced manufacturing firms—especially semiconductors design, aerospace, biotech, and high-tech R&D. Goal: Steal blueprints, formulas, and innovations to leapfrog U.S./allied tech edges. SharePoint hits let them drop backdoors for persistent access.
Why Frightening: Their zero-day speed (exploiting ToolShell days after disclosure) shows scaled ops—likely AI-assisted scanning and red-team sims. But you're right: It's not "only them." Fancy Bear/Sandworm hit Ukraine's grid with similar urgency (e.g., 2015/2022 blackouts via unpatched ICS). The difference? China's volume and deniability make it feel more existential—shutting off utilities mid-crisis isn't "war"; it's "oops."Personal take: “China's ability to jump on zero-days is frightening, but I don't have the mentality that they are the only ones. Maybe they are using it more for, in my point of view, evil (shutting off utilities for people is evil—I don't care what line you're on), but Fancy Bear/Sandworm are doing it to Ukraine.”

Violet Typhoon: Information Operations and Influence

Profile: Violet Typhoon (overlaps with RedBravo) specializes in strategic influence—blending cyber with psyops to shape narratives, sow discord, and target dissidents. Less about tech theft, more about controlling info flows.
Targets: Government agencies, defense contractors, human rights orgs, former officials, NGOs, think tanks, and media. Impacts include leaked comms for blackmail, deepfake ops, or disinformation campaigns (e.g., amplifying U.S. divisions pre-election). SharePoint exploits gave them email/docs for targeted leaks.
Broader Implications: This feeds PRC's "three warfares" doctrine (psychological, media, legal)—cyber as a force multiplier for gray-zone coercion.Personal note: “I remember when I watched the second Highlander after the quickening, and he had the ability to... he can project his consciousness? Or there was a thought that rapidly reached intelligence expanded by getting access to new tech. Basically what I'm saying: Being able to bring all knowledge and more knowledge into one location has the ability to increase human progression, and sadly, like human nature, it seems like this is for evil.”

U.S. Response and Lessons

Microsoft/FBI/CISA issued urgent patches and hunting guidance July 19–22, 2025. Sanctions targeted related PRC fronts (e.g., Integrity Tech echoes). Recommendations: Segment SharePoint, enforce least-privilege, monitor for ToolShell webshells.
For operators: Audit exposed collab tools—your plant's shared drives could be next. Zero-days hit everyone; maturity means response speed.

Wrapping the Chapter
Linen and Violet Typhoon's 2025 SharePoint spree shows Typhoons evolving: From infra sabotage (Volt) to IP grabs (Linen) to mind games (Violet). China's zero-day agility is a wake-up—fueled by state-scale hunting—but it's human nature's dark side, not monopoly evil. Knowledge as power? Highlander got it right: Quickening accelerates progress... or weaponizes it. For us in the trenches, it's patch fast, segment harder, and remember: Utilities off = lights out on progress, period.
