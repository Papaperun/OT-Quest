Sometimes when I think about running SCADA — or watching my coworkers run it — the image that pops in my head is Homer Simpson at the controls. Not because we’re stupid or brainless, but because we’re clueless.

And it’s not our fault.

Over half my life has been in this career. Almost everything I’ve ever learned was hearsay knowledge, tribal knowledge, or a sticky note taped to a monitor. Things change all the time without our awareness because the SCADA tech “knows better.”

Here’s the thing:
These systems are vast, complex, and dangerous… and you need a certification to run a forklift, but not the systems that run an entire city’s water supply.

On the OT side, we should be able to monitor changes, track baselines, and understand what’s happening. But when things get changed underneath us and we speak up, we get told:
“You don’t know what you’re talking about.”

We end up treating critical infrastructure like we’re a goon in a Batman Arkham game — our buddy just got grabbed, and we shrug and keep patrolling.

In my journey forward, I’m going to push back on that. Even if I have to start with sticky notes, I’m going to begin implementing the WaterISAC fundamentals.
Not just to complain — but to actually build something better.
