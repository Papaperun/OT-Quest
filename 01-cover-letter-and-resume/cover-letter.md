“We are taught not to talk about certain things, because talking about them feels like inviting them in.
Call it cultural memory or symbolism, but when I first learned about the Wendigo as a kid—long before it became a pop-culture trend—I remember feeling a kind of fear I recognized instinctively. A fear of something that hunts, waits, and consumes when people aren’t paying attention.
In 2025, I listened to Sandworm for the first time.
At the beginning, I honestly thought it was fiction.
When I realized it wasn’t—when I understood that these attacks were real, recent, and directly connected to the systems that keep our communities alive—I felt that same Wendigo chill.
Something predatory, silent, patient.
Something that waits for people to ignore the signs.
I’ve spent more than two decades in water operations. I know these systems, their limits, their blind spots, and the people who rely on them. That’s why I’m openly publishing my complete, field-tested study notes on ICS/OT defense for the water sector—no paywall, no gatekeeping.
I may not be able to stop every threat single-handedly, but I refuse to look away.
The least I can do is learn, document, teach, and share every piece of knowledge I gain.
This repository is part of that effort.
It isn’t fear.
It isn’t panic.
It’s awareness.
Because in cybersecurity, we don’t have to speak the threat’s name to invite it.
But we do have to speak openly if we want any chance of defending against it.”
“The Wendigo legend, at its core, is a warning about greed and cannibalism: consuming your own to survive.
To me, deliberately attacking the systems that deliver clean water, power, or any other life-sustaining service is the modern version of the same hunger. It is choosing to devour the community you came from (or could have come from) for money, ideology, revenge, or ego.
Same monster. Different forest.”
