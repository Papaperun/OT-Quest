Embracing Risk-Based Vulnerability Management
Why this is important

Vulnerabilities exist everywhere—across IT, OT, hardware, software, supply chains, contractors, and even staff practices.
No system is ever 100% patched or perfectly configured. That’s reality, not failure.

A strong vulnerability management program in OT isn’t just about “patch everything.”
It’s about understanding what matters most, what can be mitigated, and what must be monitored.

Perfection isn’t realistic — prioritization is

Sometimes you cannot patch something immediately.
Sometimes a vendor doesn’t support a new update.
Sometimes a critical system can’t be rebooted for weeks.
And sometimes, like I learned recently, pymodbus refuses to run on the newest Python version, and the only fix is reverting to an older one.

Real systems—even safe ones—require compromise.
Anyone who has ever tried installing mod packs in a game understands this frustration:
you fix one thing, and three others break.

This is why vulnerability management must be risk-based, not “patch-based.”

The goal is not “patch everything”—the goal is:

Reduce the chance of exploitation

Reduce the potential impact

Mitigate what cannot be fixed

Monitor what cannot be mitigated

Prioritize limited time, staff, and budget

Protect the mission, not the myth of perfection

Public discovery tools make this urgent

Tools like:

Shodan

Censys

Google dorking

…allow anyone—novice or malicious—to find:

exposed PLCs

open ports

unsecured HMIs

misconfigured firewalls

industrial devices sitting directly on the internet

Combine that with widely available exploitation tools like:

Metasploit

Cobalt Strike

…and even someone with minimal training can cause real damage.

(Insert the “OH NO” monkey meme here.)

Where vulnerability information comes from

Vendors issuing advisories

Cybersecurity companies

Sector-specific Information Sharing & Analysis Centers (ISACs)

Federal agencies like CISA

This is why utilities must participate in information sharing, otherwise small teams fall behind and become targets.

Small and non-technical utilities need extra support

Not every utility has:

a cybersecurity specialist

a dedicated IT team

24/7 monitoring

budget for fancy tools

staff trained to interpret detailed CVEs

For many small utilities, “vulnerability management” is a part-time job someone does on top of ten other responsibilities.

Those utilities are still targets—and often easier ones.

That’s why risk-based prioritization is crucial:
Focus on the highest-impact vulnerabilities first.
Mitigate what you can.
Monitor everything else.
And never assume that “small” means “safe.”
