Participate in Information Sharing and Collaboration Communities
Why this is important

We cannot work in a vacuum. We don’t know what we don’t know, and working with others gives us the ability to train each other, learn faster, and avoid repeating the same mistakes. Collaboration is how entire industries level up.

A perfect example comes from water treatment history:

How “Total Chlorine” Was Discovered

In the early–mid 1900s, operators only measured free chlorine residual. They assumed that if free chlorine looked good, the water was properly disinfected.

But something strange kept happening.

Operators noticed that the chlorine residual stayed high—even when there were obvious signs that something in the water should have been “using up” chlorine (ammonia, organic nitrogen, etc.). Free chlorine tests said everything was fine, but reality disagreed.

It was only because operators shared their observations that the industry realized something else was happening—leading to the discovery and standardization of combined chlorine and eventually total chlorine.

If people hadn’t spoken up, hadn’t posted results, hadn’t said “this doesn’t make sense,” our systems today could look very different.

The lesson: sharing information matters, and being willing to say “I don’t know” is a strength, not a weakness—something I personally need to remind myself of.

History of Cyber Information Sharing
PDD-63 (Presidential Decision Directive 63)

This directive encouraged the creation of sector-specific Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) to help industries collaborate on cybersecurity threats and protections.

Key benefits of cyber information sharing

Faster awareness of emerging threats – utilities get warnings earlier.

Improved detection and response through shared IoCs and threat actor behavior.

Reduced cost by spreading the intelligence burden across multiple organizations—especially important for small or under-resourced utilities.

Enhanced collaboration and trust across the sector.

Proactive security instead of reactive scrambling.

Stronger collective defense—everyone benefits when knowledge circulates.

Executive Order 13636

This EO increased the volume, timeliness, and quality of cyber threat information shared between government, private sector, and across agencies.

WaterISAC: Stronger Together

WaterISAC remains one of the best opportunities for water/wastewater utilities to collaborate, share incidents, discuss lessons learned, and raise awareness across the sector.

Our systems are interconnected. Our risks are shared. Our defenses improve only when we learn from each other.

Closing reminder

We all stand in front of an open door—one that leads to cyber risk if ignored.
If we can’t close the door, then we label it, we block it off, we communicate the hazard, just like we would with any physical safety risk.

Information sharing is part of that caution sign.

We’re stronger together.
