📌 Why This Chapter Matters

OT connections are rarely avoidable forever.
Patches, updates, vendor support, repairs, and hardware replacements will eventually require connectivity — and new parts often come with some type of network interface “baked in.”

This chapter covers how to keep necessary connections secure, documented, and controlled so they don’t become unknown vulnerabilities.

🚫 Core Principle: No OT → Public Networks

Never connect OT directly to public networks unless there is no other option.

If it must be done:

Document it clearly

Track who approved it

Note when it should be removed

Make sure it’s not forgotten (this is absolutely “spy movie” material)

📍 Key Concepts
1. Network Segmentation

Breaking the network into controlled zones to limit exposure and prevent lateral movement.

2. Firewalls

Enforce allowed traffic only.

Should be configured at each boundary between corporate, DMZ, and OT networks.

3. ICS DMZs

A buffer zone between IT and OT.

Allows controlled data flow, monitoring, and secure remote access.

4. VLANs

Logical segmentation inside the network.

Helps isolate systems without adding physical hardware.

5. Unidirectional Gateways / Data Diodes

Hardware that enforces one-way data flow.

Prevents commands or malware from crossing back into the OT side.

6. Purdue Model

A layered model of ICS networks.

You’re already able to mentally map your own system into the layers — this will help you understand exposure, traffic flow, and where to place protections.

🔍 Common Practices to Test for Undesired External Connections

(“Checking for cross-connections”)

Ping

Quick reachability tests between segments.

Netstat

Shows active connections, listening ports, and unexpected traffic.

Network path tracing (traceroute, route print)

Optional tools to understand where packets travel.

Encryption Exposure Test (Thought Exercise)

“Nude vs encrypted” idea:
Plain text = readable; encrypted = unreadable.
Might be worth finding simple Modbus or HTTP packets in Wireshark to compare.

🛡 Dragos Recommendations (Summarized)
Leverage existing infrastructure & expertise

Start with what the facility already has: switches, firewalls, policies, staff knowledge.

Implement an ICS DMZ with a secure jump host

Jump host sits between networks.

All remote access goes through it.

Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Especially for anything that touches ICS, VPNs, or jump servers.

Set strict third-party remote access requirements

No open TeamViewer.

No direct vendor access without approval and monitoring.

Monitor & audit all remote-access sessions

Logging, screen recording, or session transcripts.

Jump Servers

An intermediary server in the DMZ.

Reduces attack surface and keeps OT isolated.

VPN (Encrypted data channels)

Properly configured, limited access “slices” to specific internal resources.

SSH

Secure authentication for remote control and file transfer.

Not for casual vendor use — only for controlled operations.

🧪 Your Home Lab / Skill-Building Plan
Review: Top 20 PLC Coding Practices

Use them to build your home lab more resilient.

Ensures your understanding isn't just theoretical — it’s tied to real-world ICS engineering discipline.

Use OSINT mindset

Think like an attacker analyzing your setup.

“If bad actors know what I know, what do they target next?”
→ This pushes you to level-up your knowledge and defenses.
