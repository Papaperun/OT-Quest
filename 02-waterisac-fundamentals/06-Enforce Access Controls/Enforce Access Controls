Zero Trust & Least Privilege aren’t “IT rules.” They prevent real-world harm.
🔑 Why This Chapter Matters

Access controls are not about hurting feelings or “bruising egos.”
They are about:

preventing unauthorized commands

stopping malware from gaining control

limiting insider threats

ensuring accountability

protecting critical systems where lives and health are on the line

Your summary nails it:

Zero trust + least privilege can save lives.

And you are right:
When you are responsible for critical systems, you care more about who touches them.

📜 Fewer Credentials = Better Logging & Auditing

Having:

individual logins

per-user accounts

unique credentials

…means when something goes wrong, you can trace it.

You mentioned SCADA should have per-user logins — yes.
If Excel locks someone out every 15 minutes, that’s NOTHING compared to losing control of a plant.

🧩 RBAC — Role-Based Access Control

RBAC assigns access based on responsibilities.
It:

reduces unnecessary privileges

limits blast radius

helps investigate incidents

makes audits easier

gives operators only what they need

A junior operator does not need engineer-level write privileges.
A manager does not need direct access to PLC logic.

👑 Tenure & Seniority Don’t Equal Trust

This is a key principle:

Anyone can misuse privileged access — intentionally or unintentionally.

We’ve seen it:

well-meaning staff bypassing safety

“old-timers” using shortcuts

experienced operators clicking phishing emails

senior personnel refusing new security habits

Access should be based on role, not rank.

💀 Malware Uses the Logged-In User’s Privileges

This is huge.

If malware lands on:

a laptop logged in as an admin

a domain controller admin

an engineer account

…it inherits those privileges.
That’s why reducing permissions dramatically limits damage.

🩹 Unpatched Vulnerabilities

Unpatched systems = easy targets.
If a privileged account is logged into an unpatched system → double disaster.

😤 Zero Trust Is Annoying… and Essential

Your note about Kali asking for sudo every time:

Annoying, but it trains discipline.

Annoyance is not a security flaw — complacency is.

Zero Trust helps avoid:

silent remote access

lateral movement

compromised contractor accounts

credential reuse

pivot attacks inside OT

🛰 Zero Trust Helps Solve OT-Specific Problems

Implementing Zero Trust in OT networks helps:

control remote access to ICS

secure jump hosts

prevent lateral movement

simplify contractor identity processes

review interconnections between systems

detect single points of failure

reduce bottlenecks in network segments

🔐 Password Hygiene

You asked a powerful question:

“Could your password be discovered with OSINT?”

Often: yes.
People use pet names, birthdays, street names, sports teams.

Longer = stronger.
Passphrases, random ASCII characters, and non-dictionary patterns are best.

🤦 Your Reaction to Required Password Updates

Your honesty here is important:

“Great, now I’ll have to hold everyone’s hand through their new password.”
“That’s not the right mindset.”

Correct — and you recognized it.
Security culture requires patience, teaching, and empathy… even when coworkers make you want to bang your head on a pipe rack.

🔐 Multifactor Authentication (MFA)

MFA dramatically reduces unauthorized access.
But people struggle with it — even seasoned operators.

Your frustration is justified:

“We treat people’s water!”

MFA isn't optional for critical systems anymore.

Threats:

MFA fatigue / prompt bombing

Phished codes

SIM swaps on personal phones

Push exhaustion

Proper configuration is key.

⚠️ Case Study: Municipal Water Authority of Aliquippa (2023)

Iranian-backed CyberAv3ngers compromised:

Israeli-made Unitronics Vision Series PLCs

Exposed directly to the internet

Using default password 1111

Using default port 20256

Rebranded versions may appear under different manufacturers — hidden supply chain exposure.

You noted:

“Possibly an insider threat at the manufacturer level.”
There is ongoing debate about that; nothing is proven, but supply chain risk is real.

🚪 Access Must Be Removed When No Longer Needed

Physical access

SCADA logins

VPN accounts

Remote access contracts

Contractor badges

Default passwords

If someone leaves or stops needing access, disable it immediately.

🧠 Educating Employees

Staff need to understand:

how passwords work

why strong passwords matter

why regular changes matter

how their actions affect public safety

how to avoid social engineering

Education is the only long-term solution.

👤 HMI Account Structure

A good HMI access model includes:

1. Default (Basic) Account

View-only

Auto-login

No writing or configuration changes

Times out or locks on inactivity

2. Operator Account

Has control permissions

Limited alarm & setpoint changes

Cannot modify configuration or system files

3. Senior Operator / Manager

Can change critical setpoints

Can acknowledge/modify alarms

Should NOT have engineering privileges

4. Engineer Account

Full administrative access

Can modify HMI configuration

Should be used only when necessary

Should require MFA

This hierarchy prevents accidental or malicious misuse.

perator vs Engineer: Why Both Matter in Access Control

While engineering roles often have deep technical knowledge of PLC logic, networking, and configuration, operators hold the operational and regulatory knowledge that keeps the system safe day-to-day. A senior operator often understands:

Minimum PSI or flow required by law

Regulatory limits set by TCEQ or similar agencies

Treatment chemical minimum/maximum thresholds

Safety margins specific to that facility

How the plant behaves under load, weather, power fluctuations, or emergency conditions

Engineers may not know these operational constraints, especially if they come from outside the water sector or rotate between sites. That’s not incompetence — it’s just domain focus.

This is why access control should not give engineers unilateral power, and operators must still be involved in any change that could impact:

Regulatory compliance

Water quality

Minimum service pressure

Public safety

Distribution system hydraulics

Treatment process stability
