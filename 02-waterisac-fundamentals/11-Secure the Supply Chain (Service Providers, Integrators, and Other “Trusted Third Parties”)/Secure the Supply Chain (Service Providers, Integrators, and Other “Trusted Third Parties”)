Secure the Supply Chain (Service Providers, Integrators, and Other “Trusted Third Parties”)
Why this is important

You cannot run a modern utility without third-party vendors. But as my dad used to say, “More parts, more chances for leaks.”
He meant physical leaks in the pipes—but in cybersecurity, it’s about more points of attack.

The MITRE ATT&CK framework calls this “abusing trusted relationships”: adversaries often infiltrate organizations through smaller, less secure vendors who already have access to the intended target.

Famous Supply Chain Breaches

Target (2013):
A small HVAC vendor was spear-phished. Attackers used its network credentials to access Target’s systems. This breach is still a classic case study for third-party risk management.

SolarWinds (2020):
Over 18,000 customers installed a compromised Orion update, affecting U.S. government agencies and private companies like Microsoft, Intel, and Cisco.

Log4Shell (2021):
Critical vulnerability in the Apache Log4j 2 Java library, widely used in enterprise apps, cloud services, IoT, and SCADA systems—including water/wastewater ICS devices.
Experts believe the full impact may take years to surface.

Unitronics Vision Series PLC (2023):
Iranian-backed hackers exploited default passwords (“1111”) to compromise PLCs in multiple U.S. water/wastewater utilities.

MOVEit (2023):
A flaw in MOVEit Managed File Transfer was exploited by the CL0P ransomware group, affecting thousands of organizations and leaking data of ~77 million individuals.

These cases show how one small, insecure link can compromise entire networks.

Secure by Design Guidance

Utilities can demand security during procurement. Some best practices include:

Vendor policies and pledges:

Has the manufacturer taken CISA’s Secure by Design Pledge?

Are progress reports publicly available?

Patch management:

Are patches easy to install?

Is support provided for widespread, automated updates?

Authentication & access control:

Is Single Sign-On (SSO) offered at no cost?

Are MFA or other phishing-resistant methods enabled by default?

Have default passwords been eliminated?

Vulnerability management:

Are known vulnerabilities addressed systematically?

Is there a roadmap for unaddressed vulnerabilities?

Transparency:

Is a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) available in machine-readable format?

Does it list all third-party dependencies, including open-source components?

Open source security:

Are contributions vetted to sustain open-source projects?

Is there an established process, like an Open Source Program Office (OSPO)?

Vulnerability disclosure:

Are CVE records accurate and include CWE and CPE fields?

Does the manufacturer allow testing by the public through a vulnerability disclosure policy?

Sometimes the lowest bidder is the lowest bidder for a reason.

Takeaways for ICS/OT

Third-party vendors are potential attack vectors.

Supply chain security isn’t optional—it’s mission-critical.

Assess vendors, demand security by design, and always verify access, authentication, and patch management before trusting a product or service.
