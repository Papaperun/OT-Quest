You can’t defend against what you can’t see.
🔑 Why This Chapter Matters

System monitoring is essential because:

You don’t know the wendigo is out there unless you’ve been taught what its tracks look like.

Threat detection is the skill of learning the signs:

unusual behavior

abnormal communication

unexpected device activity

patterns that deviate from normal operations

ICS attacks rarely start with explosions — they start with small anomalies.

🇺🇸 2021 ICS Cybersecurity Initiative

This initiative is very recent, which highlights:

The field is still growing

Standards are evolving

Water sector cybersecurity is still catching up

(Your note: “Maybe there is room for Joshua still?” — yes, there is. ICS cybersecurity talent is extremely limited and highly sought after.)

The initiative created a vendor-neutral, government + critical infrastructure coalition focused on:

common standards

detection visibility

practical guidance

reducing attack blind spots

📡 Key Questions of the Initiative
1. What data acquisition capabilities exist or are planned?

Meaning:

What systems can already collect logs?

What logs will we need in the future?

What tools can pull OT-relevant data?

Includes:

PLC logs

HMI logs

Historian data

Firewall logs

Network traffic captures

Remote access logs

2. What vendors are used across the “system of interest”?

System of Interest (SOI) = the entire environment you’re trying to protect.
This could include:

All water treatment plants

All pump stations

All SCADA servers

All PLC brands and models

Cloud services

Communications paths

Anything that affects operations

Knowing vendors = knowing attack surfaces.

3. What workforce and capabilities exist or will be needed?

Realistically, most utilities:

have very limited cybersecurity staff

have operators doing 10 jobs at once

have small budgets

are just starting to understand OT monitoring

This is normal — the entire ICS sector is still developing its workforce.

📊 The Monitoring Philosophy
1. Establish a Baseline

Every ICS system must define its normal:

normal traffic flows

normal PLC cycle times

normal remote access patterns

normal network usage

normal chemical dosing behavior

normal pump runtimes

Think of it like any monitoring system:
You need a standard before you can detect deviation.

2. Detect Deviation From Baseline

Anything outside the baseline = possible threat.

Your “napalm option” metaphor works —
meaning:
If something is way outside normal, it should trigger serious attention.

Examples of anomalies:

PLC suddenly enters program mode

New devices appear on a control network

Remote access at 3am from an unknown laptop

Rapid changes in pump commands

Historian dropping logs unexpectedly

🏢 Why a Utility Needs a Security Operations Function

A utility without a Security Operations System (SOC) lacks the ability to respond properly.

Without monitoring:

Threats go unnoticed

No one sees early attack stages

Incidents take longer to detect, contain, or recover from

Regulators may ask questions later

Insurance claims get messy

This chapter reinforces:

Failing to plan is planning to fail.
(And ICS failures aren’t just IT issues — they can become public health issues.)
