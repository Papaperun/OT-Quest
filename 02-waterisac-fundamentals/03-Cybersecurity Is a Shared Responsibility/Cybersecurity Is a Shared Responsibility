Theme: Cybersecurity Is a Shared Responsibility
🔑 Core Concept

Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility, similar to an open door or open gate on a facility.

The real issue:
Most employees are not trained to even see the door is open.

If staff are kept in the dark, they simply don’t know what they don’t know.

(Your thought) “I wonder if, in human history, we ever had to learn to close the door to keep the monsters out.”
This actually fits — cybersecurity is a new kind of “monster at the gates,” and people need training to recognize it.

🧠 Culture Must Support Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity must come from the top down in the organization.

Your note: You think it should be lateral as well — meaning leadership sets the culture, but everyone, across every role, shares responsibility.

This is correct: the most successful organizations have top-down vision and side-to-side reinforcement.

🏛 National Cybersecurity Alliance (NCA)

Provides awareness programs and guides.

TL;DR:
They are basically pushing the same safety culture we already use for:

back safety

ladder safety

chemical safety
But rarely do they tell employees:
→ “Hey, don’t put your password there.”

This highlights the gap between physical safety training and cybersecurity awareness training.

👤 Insider Threats — A People Problem

Insider threats are one of the biggest risks to water/ICS systems.

Types of Insider Threats
1. Negligent / Accidental

Usually due to lack of awareness

Clicking phishing emails

Misconfiguring systems

Weak passwords

2. Malicious

Intentional sabotage, revenge, or reputation damage

3. Theft

Stealing data, access, credentials, materials

4. Espionage

Selling access or intelligence to competitors, criminals, or hostile actors

Most insider threats are NOT malicious — they are accidental.
Which ties back to the theme:
→ Employees aren’t trained to see the open cybersecurity “door.”

⚠️ Top Five Insider-Threat Stressors

(Things that increase the chance someone becomes a risk)

Termination

Fired staff may act impulsively or out of anger.

Resignation

People leaving may take data, credentials, or “borrow” access.

Internal Position Change

Conflicting access rights.

Old privileges not removed.

Organizational Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A)

New systems, new people, unknown access.

Emergency Financial Problems

Desperation → selling access on dark markets.

These are all documented risk indicators in insider threat models (CERT-NIST).
