Develop and Enforce Cybersecurity Policies and Procedures (Governance)
Why this is important

Policies and procedures are the framework that keeps your systems safe.
Without documented steps, even the best technology and trained staff can fail under stress. Clear documentation helps mitigate damage before, during, and after an incident.

Key Principles

Treat cybersecurity policies like a SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)

They should be clear, actionable, and unambiguous.

A new employee should be able to pick up the policy and perform the task correctly without needing clarification.

Avoid vague statements like “do this, or else” — instead, explain why it matters and what could happen if it’s ignored.

Dissemination and education

Policies don’t protect you if no one knows them.

Spread the policies throughout the organization through:

Training

Internal communications

Workshops or practical exercises

Everyone should understand not only what to do, but why it matters.

Lead by example

Policies should be applied consistently, at all levels.

Avoid a “do as I say, not as I do” approach — if leadership ignores procedures, the rest of the staff will too.

Auditing and testing

Policies must be tested regularly, just like other SOPs:

Ask employees to perform a task within the scope of their work to see if they can follow the documented procedure correctly.

Track and correct gaps in understanding or execution.

This ensures policies are not only written, but practically enforceable.

Continuous improvement

Cybersecurity threats evolve, and so should your policies.

Review and update policies based on:

Lessons learned from incidents

New technologies

Regulatory changes

SANS Institute Policy Templates:
Network Device Management Policy

SANS provides a wide library of ready-to-use policy templates, which can be adapted for ICS/OT environments.

💡 Pro tip for ICS/OT:
Treat your cybersecurity policies like your physical safety SOPs.
If you wouldn’t hand a new operator an untested procedure for a high-pressure chemical valve, don’t hand them an untested cybersecurity procedure either. The principle is the same: clarity, education, and enforceability save lives and systems.
