Why This Matters

Weak physical security completely undermines cybersecurity.
If an attacker can touch a device, they can often bypass digital protections entirely. Many routers, switches, and OT devices do not care who plugs in — they simply accept the connection. This is why there’s an old saying:

“If you can touch it, you can own it.”

Attackers seek physical access to:

Conduct surveillance

Gather intelligence

Identify wiring, labeling, or network layout

Install malicious devices

Steal passwords or credentials

Access ICS/OT equipment directly

Physical security is the first wall. If it fails, the rest of your cybersecurity stack becomes irrelevant.

1. Access Control: Badges, Gates, and Identity

Badges, keycards, gates, and cameras only work when the gate itself is secure.
Gate codes should not be common knowledge.
If automated, codes should be tied to individual users and changed regularly.

Attackers frequently rely on social engineering to bypass physical controls. They may:

Pretend to be a delivery driver

Claim to be an inspector

Tailgate or piggyback behind an employee

Fabricate emergencies

Exploit employees' tendency to be helpful

You’ve personally seen this in action — a coworker falling for an iTunes scam. Attackers will exploit any human weakness.

2. Workstation and Information Security

Even if someone can’t get inside the network room, they may still target exposed information.

Employees should:

Always lock their workstation

Use privacy screens to avoid shoulder-surfing

Secure confidential papers

Avoid writing passwords on sticky notes

Follow a “clean desk” policy

Keep filing cabinets locked

Use headphones for sensitive calls or alarms

Physical access doesn’t require entering the SCADA room.
Sometimes all an attacker needs is a password taped to a monitor.

3. Physical Penetration Testing

Physical penetration tests exist to do more than test doors and fences. They identify:

Weak entry points

How a physical breach could lead to IT/OT system access

Overlooked environmental factors (snowbanks, construction piles, pallets)

Whether employees challenge unknown individuals

These tests often reveal vulnerabilities created simply by convenience or familiarity.

4. Common Physical Bypass Techniques

Attackers have many tools and tricks to bypass physical security, including:

Sebaceous oil smudges on keypads to guess PINs

Snowbanks / dirt piles / construction materials enabling climbing over fences

Traveler hooks (Shrum tools) to bypass dead-latch locks

Knife bypass tools for certain padlocks

Wafer keys to open warded outdoor generator locks

Double-door tools to engage interior push bars

Thumb-turn (J-tools) to twist interior door knobs

Under-the-door tools to pull down interior door levers

These aren’t hypothetical — these tools cost under $20 and work frighteningly well.

5. Protecting ICS and SCADA Areas

Gaining access to control rooms nearly always means gaining access to:

PLCs

Operator workstations

HMIs

Historian servers

Switches and routers

Engineering workstations

To safeguard these, utilities should:

Lock hard drives and portable media

Store removable media in secured containers

Disable USB ports where possible

Disable unneeded buttons (e.g., power switches)

Use physical block-out devices

Store keys and fobs in secured locations

Attackers frequently plant malicious USBs, waiting for an employee to plug them in. This is not paranoia; it is one of the most common attack vectors.

6. Decommissioned and New Equipment

Security doesn’t end when a device leaves service.

Decommissioned equipment may still contain logs, configs, credentials, or IP mappings

New equipment can be tampered with—an attacker may install malware and “return” the device looking unopened

This is especially dangerous in water utilities where equipment turnover is slow and oversight is limited.

Summary

Physical security failures allow attackers to bypass every digital defense.
Every utility must assume:

If someone can physically reach a device, they can compromise it.

Human helpfulness will be exploited.

Small oversights create massive risks.

Cybersecurity and physical security are not separate.
In ICS/OT, they are the same fight.
