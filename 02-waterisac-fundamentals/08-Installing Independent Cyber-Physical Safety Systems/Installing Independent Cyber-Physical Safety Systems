Why This Matters

Automation is powerful — until it fails.
A water utility must answer one simple question:

If the automated system goes down, can the operators still safely run the plant?

You must be able to:

Run in manual

Calculate dosages with a basic calculator

Adjust chemical feed without automation

Manually open or close valves

Control flow, pressure, and chlorine residuals the old-school way

If a signal is corrupted or spoofed, you should still be able to keep the system safe using basic, physical controls. Automation speeds up operations, but it must never be the only layer of protection.

1. Why Adversaries Target Cyber-Physical Systems

Attackers may compromise systems for many reasons:

Ransom or extortion

Testing attacks on smaller utilities before moving to larger ones

Causing chaos or public panic

Political motivations

Proving a capability

Exploiting a system simply because it’s exposed

In OT, an attack is not just data loss. It affects physical equipment, pumps, valves, chemical feed systems, pressure zones, and water quality.

2. The AURORA Attack: A Real, Physical Warning

In 2007, Idaho National Labs conducted the now-famous AURORA test, demonstrating how a cyber-attack could physically destroy a large diesel generator by manipulating timing signals.

You mentioned reading about this in Sandworm — and you're absolutely right:
That story sticks with people because it shows that:

Cyber attacks can shatter metal. Not just software. Not just screens. Actual steel.

That moment was an entire industry wake-up call.

3. Engineering Out the Catastrophe

The same way a generator can be protected from an AURORA-style attack using:

Properly engineered protection relays,

Mechanical low-water cutoffs on boilers,

Hardwired trip switches that don’t rely on the network,

…water systems can also be protected using independent, cyber-immune protections.

These protections should:

Operate without PLCs or SCADA

Be wired physically, not digitally

Fail safe

Not depend on the ICS network

Override malicious or incorrect signals

Examples:

Hardwired level switches that shut pumps off

Physical pressure relief valves

Chlorine gas regulators with mechanical failsafes

Independent float switches on clearwells

Hard stops on actuators preventing over-closure

Backup analog sensors that operators can read manually

4. What Happens Without Independence

Without independent safety systems, an attacker could:

Slam an actuator closed

Force a pump to run against a closed valve (burnout risk)

Push a pump beyond its rated pressure or flow

Rapidly cycle pumps on/off

Override tank levels

Disable chemical feed interlocks

Bypass temperature or flow protections

Tamper with dosing calculations

Cause pressure events in distribution

Trigger low-chlorine or over-chlorination incidents

Many water utilities operate with one main high service pump.
One mistake — or one malicious action — can take that out.

And in water systems, you don’t get a second chance.

5. Consequence-driven Cyber-informed Engineering (CCE)

The approach you mentioned — CCE (Consequence-driven Cyber-informed Engineering) — is exactly the model utilities should follow.

CCE asks:

What is the worst thing that could physically happen?
(e.g., pump explosion, over-chlorination, loss of pressure)

How could a cyber attacker cause that?

What independent physical safeguards stop that — even if the network is fully compromised?

How do we design the system so forcing a catastrophic outcome becomes physically impossible?

CCE shifts the mindset from:

“How do we protect the network?”
to
“How do we protect the system even if the network is breached?”

This is the future of OT defense, especially for critical infrastructure.

6. Summary

Automation is not enough. Cybersecurity is not enough.
Independent, cyber-immune safety systems are your last line of defense.

A water plant must be operable:

Under attack

Offline

Manually

With paper log sheets

With analog gauges

With operators who know the math

When automation lies, physics tells the truth.

Independent safety systems ensure the physics wins.
