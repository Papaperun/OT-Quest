You can’t protect what you don’t know exists.
🔑 Why This Chapter Matters

Identifying and inventorying critical assets shows you:

what matters most

what needs protection

what could cause serious impact if compromised

Most importantly:

Sensors AND actuators are both critical.
You had a realization here, and it’s an important one:
You were thinking only about sensors, but actuators (pumps, valves, chemical feeds, motors) are often more dangerous if tampered with.

Attackers WANT actuators — that’s how real-world physical damage happens.

🎯 Critical Assets Include

Sensors

Actuators

Pumps

Motors

PLCs

HMIs

SCADA servers

Historians

Remote access pathways

Network gear

Wireless radios

Chemical feed systems

Backup power

Basically, anything that affects control, safety, or compliance.

🎥 Your Transporter Movie Analogy

Perfectly accurate:
If a team doesn’t know what they’re transporting (protecting), they can’t secure it.

Same for ICS:

Knowing what you're protecting defines how you protect it.

📘 Asset Lists & IP Tracking

Maintaining:

a list of all IP addresses,

all devices,

all changes on the network

…is essential.
And you’re already doing this at home with Nmap — that’s real-world skill-building.

📚 IEC 62443

You keep seeing it because:

It’s the gold standard for ICS security

It covers segmentation, asset identification, secure development, vendor requirements

Many utilities will move toward it in the next few years

Yes — worth looking up.
It’s basically the “NFPA Handbook” of ICS cybersecurity.

📝 Maintain Accurate Documentation

This includes:

Baselines

Network diagrams

Device counts

Firmware versions

Patch levels

IP allocations

User accounts

Your idea:

A Raspberry Pi could sit on the network counting things with a 5-line script

Yep — absolutely valid.
That is literally the foundation of what commercial OT monitoring appliances do.

You’re thinking like an engineer and a defender.

📦 Backup, Spares & Lifecycle Planning

The chapter mentions key policies every utility should have:

1. Backup & Spares Policy

Because supply chains fail.
You may not get replacement parts for:

PLCs

radios

HMIs
for months.

2. Ability to Rebuild to Known-Good Configuration

You need trained staff who can rebuild:

PLC logic

HMI projects

SCADA servers

network configs

Operator turnover makes this hard for small utilities.

3. Secure Products Requiring Internet/Cloud/Wireless

Anything cloud-connected MUST have:

MFA

firewalls

vendor access controls

patching schedules

4. Vendor Vetting Process

Look for:

MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures)

End of Service dates

End of Support dates

support roadmap

5. Controls Before EOS

Before a device goes out of support:

isolate it

segment it

restrict traffic

add monitoring

plan replacement

🚶 Physical Inspection

Automation is great, but you still have to walk the facilities.

Physical inspection includes:

opening control cabinets

checking racks

confirming serial numbers

confirming firmware

identifying old radios

verifying cable paths

checking unlabeled switches

verifying what devices actually exist onsite

Your note nailed it:

Automation is nice, but get off your ass.

Perfectly captures the reality of ICS.
