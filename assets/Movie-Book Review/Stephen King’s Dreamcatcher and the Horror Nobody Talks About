Stephen King’s Dreamcatcher and the Horror Nobody Talks About
From Pennywise in the Derry sewers to rabid St. Bernards in Castle Rock, from resurrected pets in Ludlow to cosmic turtles vomiting universes, King has given us every flavor of nightmare.
But in Dreamcatcher (the book especially), there’s a monster far scarier than the shit-weasels or even the Wendigo riding the storm:
The complete and total collapse of a municipal water system with zero alarms, zero operator response, and zero common sense.
Yes, we all remember the alien fungus, the quarantine zone, and the telepathic friends.
But I’m here for the part that keeps water-treatment and OT people up at night:
How the entire drinking-water supply for half of Maine gets turned into spore soup… and not a single pH probe, chlorine analyzer, or on-call tech notices until people are literally exploding in the toilet.
Like my Batman Begins autopsy, we’ll start with the required disclaimers:
Yes, it’s Stephen King on a three-day cocaine bender (his words, not mine).
Yes, the plot needs the water to be contaminated or we don’t get alien body horror.
Yes, the military is hiding everything and the fungus grows faster than common sense.
Fine. Storytelling established.
Now suspend disbelief exactly long enough for someone who stares at clearwells and SCADA trends for a living to walk you through why this is the single most terrifying failure of basic OT security, process safety, and “don’t store aliens in the raw water intake” in literary history.
Buckle up.
The Derry Water Department is about to make Gotham look competent.
