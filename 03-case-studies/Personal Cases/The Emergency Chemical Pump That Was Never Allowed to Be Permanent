Case Study: The Emergency Chemical Pump That Was Never Allowed to Be Permanent
“The Padlock Defense”
Industry: Municipal / Industrial Water Treatment
Date of incident: ~2019–2020 (exact year redacted)
Author reflection: Written December 2025 with current OT/ICS security knowledge
1. Background
The plant uses polymer for flocculation. A single primary metering pump feeds all flocculator wells. Administration wanted a fully installed “emergency backup pump” that could be switched on immediately if the primary pump failed. Their chosen location: directly inside one of the flocculator wells. Their concept of operations: flip a switch and walk away.
2. Immediate Red Flags (identified at the time, pre-OT training)
Any permanent chemical injection point requires state TCEQ (regulatory) approval → none existed.
No flow measurement, no dosage feedback, no high-level interlock, no anti-siphon, no check valve monitoring.
Proposed electrical design: hard-wired-on, no permissives, no HMI integration, no remote stop.
Effectively an open-loop, unmonitored chemical weapon sitting in the process.
3. What Actually Happened (the compromise)
I executed the following field-engineer countermeasures:
Installed all suction/discharge tubing and isolation valves exactly as requested (so a real emergency could be responded to in <10 min).
Ran temporary-power conduit and receptacle but never terminated the circuit permanently.
Removed the actual peristaltic metering pump from the well and placed it in a locked instrumentation cabinet (key held only by shift supervisors).
Wrote and trained a strict step-by-step SOP: locate pump → retrieve key → connect power whip → connect tubing quick-connects → set speed manually using calibrated draw-down → operator must remain present until complete.
Pump cannot run without deliberate, multi-step human action every single time.
Result: the plant has a functional emergency capability, but zero possibility of accidental or unauthorized continuous dosing.
4. Retrospective Analysis with Modern OT/ICS Knowledge (2025 lens)
What I instinctively did in 2019–2020 maps 1:1 to current best practice in both functional safety and OT cybersecurity:
Risk
Mitigation I applied
Modern framework alignment
Unauthorized actuation
Physical removal of actuator + locked storage
True air-gap (stronger than network segmentation)
Insider threat / poor judgment
Only trained operators have key and SOP
Principle of least privilege + human-in-the-loop
Zero monitoring / runaway dosing
Forced manual operation every time
Defense-in-depth; eliminates hidden failure modes
Permanent unapproved injection point
Nothing is actually permanent
Regulatory compliance preserved
Single-point brainless automation
Procedure-based control instead
Aligns with IEC 62443-3-3 SR 1.1 (Identification & authentication), FR 2 (Use control), and NIST 800-82 physical security recommendations

5. Key Lessons (now that I actually know the buzzwords)
The biggest OT threat at most sites is still authorized but incompetent people, not nation-state hackers.
When leadership demands something stupid, you can often give them 95 % of what they want while quietly enforcing the 5 % that actually keeps the plant safe and legal.
Physical security beats cybersecurity every time you can use it. A $5 padlock and a 30 lb pump in a cage is more secure than Purdue Level 2 role-based access control.
“Convenience” is the mortal enemy of both safety and security. If something is too easy to start, it will eventually start itself at 3 a.m. on a holiday.
Never underestimate the power of “making it someone’s deliberate job” instead of “making it automatic.”
6. Closing Thought
Years before I ever read IEC 62443, NIST 800-82, or ISA-TR84.00.09, I accidentally implemented one of the strongest possible controls: remove the pump and lock it up.. Turns out common-sense engineering and modern OT security converge in exactly the same place.
The pump is still in that locked cabinet in 2025. It has been used exactly Never in the time it has been in place; both times by the book, both times saved the day, and zero incidents.
Sometimes the best security patch is a padlock and a healthy distrust of idiots with good intentions.
Case closed. Literally.
