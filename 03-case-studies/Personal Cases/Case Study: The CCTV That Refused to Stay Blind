Case Study: The CCTV That Refused to Stay Blind/ Cyber Secuity is only as good as the phyical one 
“The Spite That Went Through Channels (and Added a $35 Chime)”
Industry: Water/Wastewater Treatment
Timeline: ~2020–2021
Author reflection: December 2025, full story with all the petty details
Motivation: 85 % spite, 15 % actual security.
The day-shift crowd still refused to type their PINs, but now they had a new excuse after we fixed the camera:
“Well… we didn’t HEAR anyone at the gate!”
So I spent $35 of my own money (later expensed) on a simple gate-chime alarm: a magnetic reed switch on the gate arm wired to a 12 V buzzer in the control room.
When the gate arm lifts or someone tailgates, it goes DING-DING-DING-DING loud enough that you can’t ignore it even with headphones on.
Complete Package We Delivered (all approved, all documented)
Dedicated ex-surplus OptiPlex running only the camera client 24/7 (formal policy exception).
Separate unmanaged switch for logical isolation.
Wall-mounted 24" monitor labeled “GATE – ALWAYS ON.”
$35 gate-chime alarm wired directly to the gate controller relay (now audible notification of every entry attempt).
End Result
Visual proof of who’s at the gate: 100 %
Audible proof someone’s at the gate: 100 %
Phone calls to open the gate for lazy people: 0 % (forever)
The chime was the kill shot. After the third “DING-DING-DING” went off while someone sat there pretending they didn’t know how to type four numbers, even the laziest supervisor gave up and started using their PIN.
Updated 2025 Takeaways
A $35 hardware store buzzer can be the most effective access-control enforcement device on site.
When you combine always-on visibility with an annoying noise, human behavior changes instantly.
Best security improvements usually have three ingredients:
A real vulnerability
An operator who’s personally offended by it
Something that makes laziness audible to everyone in the room
Five years running. Zero gate calls. The chime still works. The OptiPlex still works. My sanity is still intact.
Moral: Never underestimate the power of a loud buzzer and a well-channeled grudge.
Case closed. For real this time. And it still goes ding
